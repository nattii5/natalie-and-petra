      <p> As part of our AS/A2 PE syllabus we cover Sport Psychology as one of our major modules and I was delighted to have Rebecca come in to Epsom College and lecture to some of our more senior pupils. She covered the topics in both an entertaining and informative way and her rapport with the students was excellent. In essence she really did genuinely impress both with her knowledge and delivery. She has resources to hand, video clips to supplement her topic and questions to challenge the more able whilst keeping the others still firmly engaged.

      <p>We sought help from Rebecca after our son was displaying signs of stress which were evident at home on a day-to-day basis leading up to end of year exams. Rebecca was able to diffuse the situation which had developed at home by providing our son with a mental map to his emotions, giving recognition, credence and the appropriate weight to his concerns. After half a dozen sessions our son has adopted his own personally devised and child specific coping mechanisms which provide the pegs upon which he can and does hang up his emotions and difficulties. Rebecca is performing the valuable function of assisting a pre-adolescent boy and his parents through the minefield of growing up.</p>

     <p>Rebecca came into my year four class to lead a workshop on how to have a healthy attitude towards sport. Rebecca was very enthusiastic and the children took a lot from the workshop. She led a discussion on sportsmanship and how to take away positives from sport even when you lose. This was an excellent workshop and particularly relevant in a society where children do not experience losing at sport and thus find it very difficult. I hope she will come and do another workshop in the next Healthy Schools week!</p>
